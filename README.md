# Background 

This project uses VBA scripting to analyze stock market data. The analysis was divided into two datasets, Test and Main.  The Test Data was used to develop the script for the Main data to execute the script. Both datasets were loaded into MS Excel.  The test data had a smaller file size for faster loading and testing. The main data had three sheets categorized by year 2018, 2019 and 2020.  It had a larger file in size and took longer to execute the script.

## Instructions:
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

1.  The ticker symbol

2.  Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

3.  The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
4.  The total stock volume of the stock. 
5.  Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
6.  Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
7.  Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
