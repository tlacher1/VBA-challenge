# Background 

This project uses VBA scripting to analyze stock market data. The analysis was divided into two datasets, Test and Main.  The Test Data was used to develop the script for the Main data to execute the script. Both datasets were loaded into MS Excel.  The test data had a smaller file size for faster loading and testing. The main data had three sheets categorized by year 2018, 2019 and 2020.  It had a larger file in size and took longer to execute the script.

## Instructions:
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

1.  The ticker symbol

2.  Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

3.  The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
